# Ibrida Compiler
Why? Idk I'm bored. 

Ibrida comes from the Latin origin of the english word Hybrid. Chosen because this is really just a mashup __*or hybrid*__ of a bunch of languages I've used before.

## The Goal
Create a compiler for my own programming language called Ibrida

### Current Goal Checklist
- [x] Implement constructing token vector
- [ ] Construct an AST with an LL(1) Parser (or maybe a Pratt Parser??) from the token vector
- [ ] Compile main0.ibi to an executable file
- [ ] Compile main1.ibi to an executable file
- [ ] Compile main2.ibi to an executable file
