# Ibrida Compiler
Why? Idk I'm bored. 

Ibrida comes from the Latin origin of the english word Hybrid. Chosen because this is really just a mashup *or hybrid* of a bunch of languages I've used before.

## The Goal
Create a compiler for my own programming language called Ibrida
- Current goal: compile the main.ibi file into a .exe file
- Future goal: Make it turing complete
