# Ibrida Compiler
Why? Idk I'm bored. 

Ibrida comes from the Latin origin of the english word Hybrid. Chosen because this is really just a mashup __*or hybrid*__ of a bunch of languages I've used before.

## The Goal
Create a compiler for my own programming language called Ibrida


### Current Goal Checklist
- [x] Implement constructing token vector
- [x] Construct an AST for main0.ibi with a Pratt Parser from the token vector
- [ ] Create an annotated / typed AST using semantic analysis
- [ ] Compile main0.ibi to LLVM IR
- [ ] Convert the IR to an executable
- [ ] Do the same for main1.ibi and main2.ibi
